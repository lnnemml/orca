## [2026-07-26] milestone | Project scaffold created

Initial scaffold generated from architecture planning sessions (Claude web):

- Repository structure defined: Tauri/React frontend, Rust core, Python sidecar, wiki.
- Six founding ADRs written (stack, sidecar, execution backends, storage, SSH strategy,
  manual integration).
- Roadmap drafted: Phases 0–6, each ending in a usable increment.
- Wiki system initialized per the LLM-wiki pattern (CLAUDE.md = schema).

Key founding decisions to remember:
1. ExecutionBackend abstraction from day one — remote SSH execution is a first-class,
   optional path, not a bolt-on.
2. The app is a learning instrument, not just a launcher: live convergence plots and
   integrated manual are core features.
3. Mission test for every feature: "does it lower the barrier for a terminal-shy chemist?"

Next: Phase 0 — ORCA 6 installation + environment verification, then Tauri scaffold.

## [2026-07-26] session | Phase 0: ORCA verified

Environment confirmed working end-to-end:

- ORCA **6.1.0** at `/opt/orca/orca`, system **OpenMPI 4.1.6** (compatible with this build),
  host Laptop-main (Linux Mint).
- Verification run `water_optfreq` (r²SCAN-3c `Opt Freq TightSCF`, `%pal nprocs 4`,
  `%maxcore 2000`): opt converged in 4 cycles, final energy −76.418938719971 Eh,
  frequencies 1653.26 / 3813.32 / 3932.49 cm⁻¹ (all positive → true minimum),
  `ORCA TERMINATED NORMALLY`. Full-path + `%pal` parallelism verified.
- Learned: ORCA has no CLI flags — `orca --version` is treated as an input filename.
  Version comes from the run banner (`Program Version 6.1.0`). Recorded in gotchas.

Wiki updated: `orca/orca-basics.md` (verified environment table + test results),
`orca/gotchas.md` (no `--version`). ROADMAP Phase 0 install/verify/record marked done.

Next: scaffold Tauri 2 + React + TS, then Python sidecar `/health` + SQLite init.
